		<h1>August 17, 2017</h1>
		<p>Nothing is going on in my life.</p>
		<p>I joined a few page RPS, I talked with my friends on scratch, I coded with my sister, I'm writing this post...</p>
		<p>The solar eclipse is coming.. I'm not planning on watching it. I'm starting puberty (sorry about the subject), and one of the side affects is being afraid of a lot of things, and well, I was always scared of the solar eclipse, because I was scared of going blind, and it was always making the sun "black".</p> I played some Animal Jam. barely. and I'm listening to Fall out boy and Green day.. and other bands.</p> <p>My sister has bubble tea stickers everywhere.... speaking of bubble tea, soon we're goin' to have some. Yeah get over it, my life's boring. At least I'm gonna go to a concert of one of my favourite bands in the world next year.</p> <p>Well, I know this was a short post, deal with it.</p> <p>Cheers to you, loves!</p></div>
