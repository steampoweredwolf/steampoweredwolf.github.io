		<p>I'm back with another post!</p>
		<p>Soooo... um. I don't really have anything to say, I'm doing this cuz I'm really bored X3</p>
        <p>Grans' (Grandma) is always sleeping in my room, so I'm not allowed to RP. ONE OF MY ULTIMATE WEAKNESSES!</p>
        <p>I know this will also be a pretty short post, but that's mainly because I have parents that are boring. (no offense mom and dad!)</p>
        <p>I am way more cheerful in this post than my first one X3</p>
        <p>Animal Jam is getting more boring and boring each and every day.</p>
        <p>Ok, I think It's time to go now...</p>
        <p>Cheers to you, loves!</p></div>
